<h4>1.1.5 Risks detected</h4>

<h5>Project risks:</h5>
1. Limited Testing Time:Time constraints may limit the depth and breadth of manual testing, forcing the team to prioritize certain features over others.

2. Lack of Test Documentation: Inadequate or inconsistent test documentation can result in missed test cases, difficulty in reproducing bugs, and challenges in knowledge transfer.
   
3. Tester Skill Variability:Variations in tester experience and skill levels can result in inconsistent test execution and issue detection, especially in complex areas like insurance policy management or claims processing.


4. Changing Requirements:Requirements for the website may change during the testing phase, causing confusion and necessitating re-testing of previously validated features.


5. Dependency on Third-Party Systems:The website's integration with external systems (e.g., insurance provider APIs, payment gateways) might face issues outside the control of the testing team.



<h5> Product risks: </h5>
1. Incomplete Functionality Coverage: Certain functionalities of the Otto Broker website, such as niche features within the "AsigurÄƒrile Mele" and "Dauna" sections, might not be thoroughly tested due to oversight or limited time.

2. Data Integrity Issues: Manual testing might overlook scenarios where data is incorrectly saved, displayed, or updated, especially in complex transactions like adding a new policy or processing a claim.
   
3. Performance Issues Under Load: Manual testing is often limited in its ability to simulate high traffic or peak usage conditions, potentially missing performance bottlenecks.




<h4>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h4>

__Recommendations for a Testing Team to Ensure High-Quality Work__

The testing team should invest time in understanding the Otto Broker website's functionalities, especially the critical sections like "AsigurÄƒrile Mele" and "Dauna." This includes familiarizing themselves with user stories, requirements documents, and any relevant business rules.A deep understanding of the product helps testers anticipate potential issues, create more comprehensive test cases, and ensure all critical features are thoroughly tested.

Identify and prioritize high-risk areas of the website (e.g., payment processing, user data handling) for more intensive testing. Allocate more time and resources to these areas.


Regularly review test results, analyze trends, and adjust the testing strategy as needed. Use metrics like defect density, test coverage, and pass/fail rates to measure progress and identify areas for improvement.
